> This bot is brand-spanking new. In less than 100 servers and looking after about 10,000 members. But please be aware that it is still in early development, and may be unstable and incomplete.

Arlo is an open source Discord bot that runs on the Node.JS runtime. Arlo utilises [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html). Any contributions or support (even a star!) mean a lot.
